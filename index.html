      <h3>Konstantina Alexogianni</h3>
      <p>I am a 1st year undergrad student at NTUA School of Architecture. This is my website for ARCH 4342 Computational Methods in Creative Arts and Sciences. I am very passionate about architecture and it is fascinating to me how programming can expand the creative possibilities in the architectural sector. This course, "Computational Methods in Creative Arts and Sciences" offers an ideal intersection which helps me explore innovative design through digital tools. Have a look at my projects. </p>

        <img src="images/first.png" class ="scale-with-grid">
        <h5>1st Project</h5>
        <h6> The specific project was the first one to require writing an actual code using the p5.js Web Editor. It was the one that introduced me in programming and showed me the basic commands in the p5.js programming language.Thus it was a very important project for understanding how a code becomes an image.</h6>

        <img src="images/second.png" class ="scale-with-grid">
        <h5>2nd Project</h5>
        <h6>This was the second project of the semester which demanded a slighly more complicated code than the first one due to the loop that had to be used in order for the circles to keep appearing. It also introduced me to using different colors and transparencies in my shapes.</h6>

    <div class="row half-bottom">
        <img src="images/third.png" class ="scale-with-grid">
        <h5>3rd Project</h5>
        <h6>The third project was a lot more complicated than the first two since you had to combine colors and shapes with a loop. But this time the circles that were being created from the loop had to be placed precisely in a spiral motion and not just anywhere in the screen, something that needed a lot of work on the code</h6>

    <div class="row half-bottom">
      
        <img src="images/fourth.png" class ="scale-with-grid">
        <h5>4th Project</h5>
        <h6>The fourth project is the one that i actually enjoyed working on the most. The divisions that I had to make in order to create the grid made it complicated but also very interesting. The same also happened with the use of the colors that had to be different in every sub-row and sub-column and that also caused the final result to be a very interesting image that changes every time the code is restarted.</h6>

        <img src="images/fifth.png" class ="scale-with-grid">
        <h5>5th Project</h5>
        <h6>The sixth project is very interesting because of its connection with architecture. More specifically it showcases the great connection between architecture and programming simce in the specific example through the code that I wrote in p5.js i created a city plan.</h6>

        <img src="images/sixth.png" class ="scale-with-grid">
        <h5>6th Project</h5>
        <h6>Project 6 was the last individual project of this semester in which I had to create a little snake game. It actually required a complex code that had to combine many different commands in order to reach the desired result. It is  great example of a code and a program that interacts with the user.</h6>
